    2. Write down the information that can be directly identified from each constraint (e.g., the Norwegian lives in the first house).
    3. Infers information that can be derived indirectly by combining the constraints.
    4. Repeat this process until all attributes (color, nationality, beverage, cigarette, pet) are assigned to each house.
    5. Identify the person who owns the fish and state their nationality.
