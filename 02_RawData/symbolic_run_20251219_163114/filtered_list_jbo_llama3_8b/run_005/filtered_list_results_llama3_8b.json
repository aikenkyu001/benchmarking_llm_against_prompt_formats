  "llm_response_full": "A Lojban text!\n\nHere's my attempt to translate and summarize it:\n\nThe speaker is discussing a list (liste be li'i) of some kind. They mention that the list has two parts: one part (pa moi) and another part (re moi). The first part contains items that are not specified, but the second part contains items from 1 to 10.\n\nThe speaker then says that they will provide a script (finti lo skripti) for creating this list. They also mention that there is a \"spusku\" (a Lojban term that can be translated as \"summary\" or \"digest\") of the list, which is not specified further.\n\nFinally, the speaker provides the actual list (jmina li), which contains numbers from 1 to 10.\n\nIn summary, this text appears to be a brief introduction to a list and its contents, with some technical Lojban terms thrown in.",
