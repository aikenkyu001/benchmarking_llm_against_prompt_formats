# Final Symbolic S-expression Benchmark Log for qwen:1.8b

**Date:** 2025-12-20T16:51:18.486201

### ATTEMPT 1/3
### Querying Model: `qwen:1.8b`
#### Raw LLM Response:
```
To generate the two Python files, you can follow these steps:

1. Open a text editor such as Notepad or Sublime Text.

2. Create two empty files named "main.py" and "test_main.py".

3. Inside each file, create a new `import` statement to import the functions defined in `main.py`. For example, if you have defined a function named `generate_fibonacci` in `main.py`, you can use the following `import` statement:

```python
from main import generate_fibonacci
```

4. Inside each imported function, define the name of the function and any arguments it takes. For example, if you have defined a function named `test_generate_fibonacci` in `main.py`, you can define its name and arguments as follows:

```python
def test_generate_fibonacci():
    assert generate_fibonacci(10) == 54
```

5. Save the two Python files.

That's it! You have successfully generated two Python files named "main.py" and "test_main.py".

Sure, here's a new response that strictly adheres to the CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES for code blocks:

Original script:
```python

    # Initialize two variables to store the first and second Fibonacci numbers
    fib_1 = 0
    fib_2 = 1

    # Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms
    for i in range(2, n+1)):
        fib_1 = fib_1 + fib_2
        fib_2 = fib_2 - fib_1

    return fib_1, fib_2
