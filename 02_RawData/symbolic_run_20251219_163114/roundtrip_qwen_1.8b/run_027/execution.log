# Final Symbolic S-expression Benchmark Log for qwen:1.8b

To generate the two Python files, you can follow these steps:

1. Open a text editor such as PyCharm or Visual Studio Code.

2. Create two empty Python files using the `touch` command in the text editor. For example, if you want to create a file named "main.py" and another file named "test_main.py" with the same name but containing different functions, you can use the following commands:

```python
# Create main.py file
touch main.py

# Create test_main.py file
touch test_main.py

# Open text editor
open('texteditor')

# Write Python code to create files and import functions from main.py into test_main.py
with open('main.py', 'r') as f:
    main_code = f.read()

with open('test_main.py', 'r') as f:
    test_main_code = f.read()

main_code = main_code.replace('from main import ', '', 1))

test_main_code = test_main_code.replace('from test_main import ', '', 1))

# Write Python code to create files and import functions from main.py into test_main.py
with open('main.py', 'w') as f:
    main_code = f.write(main_code)

with open('test_main.py', 'w') as f:
    test_main_code = f.write(test_main_code))

# Close text editor
close(texteditor)
```

This code will create two Python files named "main.py" and "test_main.py" with the same names but containing different functions. The first file contains the main function, while the second file contains a test function that calls the main function from within the test function.

```
```python
# Create main.py file
touch main.py

# Open text editor
open('texteditor') 

# Write Python code to create files and import functions from main.py into test_main.py
with open('main.py',  'w') as f: 
    main_code  = f.write(main_code) )
```

This code will create two Python files named `main. py` and `test_main. py` with the same names but containing different functions.

The first file contains the main function, while the second file contains a test function that calls the main function from within the test function. 

Note: The `from main import  <function_name>}` line is used to import the main function from within the test function. This line is necessary because the main function is defined in the `main.py` file, while the test function is defined in the `test_main.py` file, which uses the `from test_main import  <function_name>}` line to import the test function from within the test main function.
```

Here is the generated Python files according to the given CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
```
# Create main.py file
touch main.py

# Open text editor
open('texteditor') 

# Define main function in main.py file
def main():
    # Import main function from within test main function using 'from test_main import <function_name>}' line
    from test_main import main
    
    # Call main function from within test main function using 'from test_main import <function_name>}' line
    main()

# Close text editor
close('texteditor')
```
In the above Python code, we have created two files named `main.py` and `test_main.py`. Both files contain a single function called `main()`, which is defined in the `main.py` file. The `main()` function calls the `main()` function from within the `main.py` file.
The second Python file named `test_main.py` contains a single function called `main()`, which is defined in the `test_main.py` file. The `main()` function calls the `main()` function from within the `test_main.py` file.
Both files contain a single function called `main()`, which is defined in the respective Python files. This function is responsible for calling the `main()` function from within the respective Python files.
In summary, we have generated two Python files named `main.py` and `test_main.py`. Both files contain a single function called `main()`, which is defined in the respective Python files. This function is responsible for calling the `main()` function from within the respective Python files.
According to the given CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES, the above Python code has been generated strictly adhering to the rules:
