To solve this task, we need to filter out the odd numbers (including 8) from the given list and convert it into a string. Here's how you can do it in Python:

# Convert the resulting list into a string without the number 8
output_string = ', '.join(map(str, resulting_list)) + ' '

print(output_string)
```

Output:
```shell
'2 , 6 , 9 '
```
