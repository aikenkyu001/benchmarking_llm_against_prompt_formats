### Querying Model: `stablelm2:1.6b`
#### Raw LLM Response (first 500 chars):

To solve this task, we need to filter out the even numbers from the given list and exclude the number 8. Here's how you can do it in Python:

```python
input_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
resulting_list = [num for num in input_list if num % 2 == 0 and num != 8]

# Convert the resulting list to a string format
output_string = ', '.join(map(str, resulting_list))

print(output_string)
```

Output:
```shell
"2, 4, 6"
```

Explanation: The code filters out the even numbers (excluding 8) from the...
