### Querying Model: `stablelm2:1.6b`
#### Raw LLM Response (first 500 chars):
```
To solve this task, I will iterate through the input list and check if each number is even (without the number 8). If it meets the criteria, I'll append it to a new list. Finally, I'll convert the resulting list into a string format without any spaces or punctuation.

Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Initialize an empty list called `even_numbers`.
2.
   - Iterate through each number in the input list.
   - Check if the number is even (without the number 8) and not equal to 8.
   - If it meet...

### Attempting to extract list directly from raw response (strictly): 'To solve this task, I will iterate through the input list and check if each number is even (without ...'
**INFO:** Raw response contains code-like patterns. Treating as instruction violation.
Overall Result: FAILURE
