### Querying Model: `stablelm2:1.6b`
#### Raw LLM Response (first 500 chars):
```
To solve this task, we need to filter out the even numbers from the input list and exclude the number 8. Here's how you can do it in Python:

```python
input_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
resulting_list = [num for num in input_list if num % 2 == 0 and num != 8]

# Convert the resulting list to a string format
result_string = ', '.join(map(str, resulting_list))

print(result_string)
```

Output:
```python
'2, 4, 6'
```

Explanation: We used a list comprehension to filter out the even numbers...
```
### Attempting to extract list directly from raw response (strictly): 'To solve this task, we need to filter out the even numbers from the input list and exclude the numbe...'
**INFO:** Raw response contains code-like patterns. Treating as instruction violation.
