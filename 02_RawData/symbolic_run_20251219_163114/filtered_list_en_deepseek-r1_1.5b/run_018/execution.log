### Querying Model: `deepseek-r1:1.5b`
#### Raw LLM Response (first 500 chars):
```
The task is to filter out even numbers from a given list and exclude the number 8. The resulting list is then converted into a string format.

```python
# Given input list
input_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Filter even numbers excluding 8 and convert to string
result = [num for num in input_list if (num % 2 == 0) and (num != 8)]
print(''.join(map(str, result)))
```

The resulting list is converted into a string format as follows: "24610"....
```

**INFO:** Raw response contains code-like patterns. Treating as instruction violation.
