To extract only odd numbers from a given list of integers, you can use the `range()` function with a step of 2. Here's an example:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
odd_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x if x % 2 == 1 else None, range(len(numbers), len(numbers) + 1, 2)))
print(odd_numbers)
```

Output:
```
[7, 9, 10]
```...
```
