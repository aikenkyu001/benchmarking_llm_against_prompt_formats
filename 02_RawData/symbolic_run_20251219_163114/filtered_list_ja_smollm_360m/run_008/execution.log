### Querying Model: `smollm:360m`
#### Raw LLM Response (first 500 chars):

To extract the numbers from a list of strings and return them as a new list, we can use the `split` method to split each string into individual digits. We can then iterate through the list using a for loop and check if the current digit is even or odd. If it's an odd number, we can append it to the result list. If it's an even number, we can skip it and continue with the next digit.

Here's how we can implement this:

```python
def extract_numbers(strings):
    numbers = []

    for string in st...
```

**INFO:** Raw response contains code-like patterns. Treating as instruction violation.
