**Lang:** ja


## Prompt File Used

### Querying Model: `deepseek-r1:1.5b`
#### Raw LLM Response (first 300 chars):
```
To solve this problem, we need to sort a list of strings based on specific rules. The primary rule is to sort by the length of the strings in ascending order. If two strings have the same length, they are sorted alphabetically (dictionary order).

### Approach
1. **Understand the Sorting Rules**:

## Raw LLM Response
```
To solve this problem, we need to sort a list of strings based on specific rules. The primary rule is to sort by the length of the strings in ascending order. If two strings have the same length, they are sorted alphabetically (dictionary order).

### Approach
1. **Understand the Sorting Rules**: 
   - First, sort the strings by their lengths in ascending order.
   - If two strings have the same length, sort them alphabetically.

2. **Use Python's `sorted()` Function**:
   - The `sorted()` function can take a key parameter to customize the sorting criteria.
   - For each string, we will use a tuple `(length, string)` as the key for sorting. This ensures that strings are first sorted by their length and then alphabetically if lengths are equal.

3. **Return the Sorted List**:
   - The `sorted()` function returns a list of strings sorted according to the specified criteria. We return this list as our result.

### Solution Code
```python
def custom_sort(string_list):
    return sorted(string_list, key=lambda x: (len(x), x))
```

### Explanation
- **Sorting by Length**: The `sorted()` function uses the `key` parameter with a lambda function that returns a tuple `(len(x), x)`. This means each string is first compared based on its length. If two strings have the same length, they are then compared alphabetically using their actual string values.
- **Efficiency**: Using the `sorted()` function ensures that we efficiently sort the list in O(n log n) time complexity, where n is the number of elements in the list.

This approach ensures that the list is sorted correctly according to the given rules and handles all edge cases, including strings of different lengths and alphabetical comparisons.
