  "llm_response_full": "The given text seems to be a mix of different languages and possibly misspelled words. Based on my understanding, it appears to be in the Hawaiian language. Here's an interpretation:\n\n1. \"Pusu bo liste be li'i pa moi\" - This phrase means \"I list something for myself (without Pusu)\" or \"I am listing something for myself.\"\n2 2. \"i do puzu bo xruti pa liste be li'i re moi\" - This translates to \"I do the same with Pusu's list for my own\"\n3 3. \"i je liste be li'i re moi cu kancu loi so'e poi ke'a simsa lo'i remei be'i lista be li'i pa moi\" - This is a bit more complex and could mean something like \"I am listing something for myself (without Pusu) using the same method as Pusu's list, but with some modifications.\"\n4 4. \"i ku'i do na puzu bo jmina li 8\" - This translates to \"I did not find any Pusu's list containing eight items.\"\n5 5. \"i do na puzu bo finti lo skripti\" - This means \"I did not find the script for Pusu's list.\"\n6 6. \"i do puzu bo spusku po'o lo liste\" - This translates to \"I made a copy of Pusu's list.\"\n7 7. \"i puzu bo jmina li 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\" - These numbers represent the items in Pusu's list.\n\nSo, the text seems to be discussing the creation and understanding of a list without Pusu (or possibly \"Pusuke\"), which is similar to a Hawaiian version of a numbered list. The person is not able to find or access this list due to its absence.",
