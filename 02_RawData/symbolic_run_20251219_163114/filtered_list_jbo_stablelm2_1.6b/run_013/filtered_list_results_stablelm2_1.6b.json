  "llm_response_full": "The given text seems to be a mix of different languages and possibly misspelled words. Based on my understanding, it appears to be in the Hawaiian language.\n\nHere's an interpretation of the text:\n\n1. \"Pusu bo liste\" - This phrase means \"I have listed something for Pusu.\" In this context, Pusu is likely a person's name or a title.\n2 2. \"be li'i pa moi\" - This translates to \"that belongs to me.\"\n3 3. \"i do puzu bo xruti pa liste be li'i re moi\" - This phrase means \"I have listed something for Pusu that is relevant to me.\" Here, the speaker is listing items relevant to themselves.\n4 4. \"i je liste be li'i re moi cu kancu loi so'e poi ke'a simsa lo'i remei be'i lista be li'i pa moi\" - This translates to \"I have listed something for Pusu that is relevant to me, along with other items, because the result of this process is important.\"\n5 5. \"i ku'i do na puzu bo jmina li 8\" - This phrase means \"I did not find any information in the list of eight things.\"\n6 6. \"i do na puzu bo finti lo skripti\" - This translates to \"I did not find any script or instructions in the list.\"\n7 7. \"i do pusu bo spusku po'o lo liste\" - This phrase means \"I will send this list to Pusu for him to review and provide feedback.\"\n8 8. \"i puzu bo jmina li 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\" - These are the items that Pusu is supposed to review.\n\nSo, the text seems to be discussing a list of eight things related to someone (Pusu) and their request for feedback. The speaker mentions not finding any instructions or script in the list and sending it to Pusu for his review.",
