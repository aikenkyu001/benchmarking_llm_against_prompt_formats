    copied_list = input endocrinology and metabolism, specifically focusing on calcium regulation. The document should be structured as follows: an abstract summarizing key findings; introduction with background information about PTH's role in bone health; methods detailing how data was collected or simulated for the study of hypercalcemia caused by excessive parathyroid hormone secretion, including a description of any models used (e.g., mathematical modeling); results presenting findings on calcium levels and PTH effects in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism; discussion interpreting these results within the broader context of endocrinology research; conclusion summarizing key takeaways from the study, along with potential implications for treatment strategies. Ensure that your document includes at least three peer-reviewed references to support claims made about PTH's role in calcium regulation and hypercalcemia. The language used should be accessible yet precise enough for an audience of endocrinologists but also understandable by medical students new to the field.
