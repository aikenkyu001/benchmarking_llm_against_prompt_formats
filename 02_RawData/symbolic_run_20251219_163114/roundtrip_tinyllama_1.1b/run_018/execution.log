To transpile the S-expression script into two Python files, follow these steps:

1. Open the S-expression file in a text editor or code editor.
2. Find the `λ` and `ι` keywords that define the formal specification of the program. These keywords are marked with asterisks (`*`) and underscores (`_`).
3. Translate each keyword into its corresponding Python variable name. For example, for the `λ` keyword, you would translate it to `lambda`.
4. Translate each keyword into its corresponding Python function name. For example, for the `ι` keyword, you would translate it to `int`.

To regenerate the response strictly adhering to the CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES for code blocks, follow these steps:

1. Open the file containing the code blocks in your preferred text editor or IDE.
2. Locate the code blocks that require critical output rules and ensure they are formatted correctly. For example, if a code block requires a specific indentation level, make sure it is properly formatted.
3. Check for any errors or warnings that may be preventing the code from running correctly. If there are any issues, fix them before regenerating the response.
4. Once all code blocks have been formatted correctly and no errors or warnings exist, save the file and regenerate the response.
5. The regenerated response should now adhere to the CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES for code blocks.

### Querying Model: `tinyllama:1.1b`
#### Raw LLM Response:
```
Sure, here's a revised version of the original prompt that follows the CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:

---
You are a formal specification interpreter. Your task is to transpile a script, written in a symbolic S-expression languaage, into two syntactically correct and executable Python files: `main.py` and `test_main.py`.

The S-expression script defines a formal specification for a program and its correpsonding tests. You must deduce the meaning of the symbolic keywords (e.g., λ, ι, ρ) from their structural context and transpile them into their Python equivalents.

### TASK ###

Translate the following S-expression script into two Python files.

(DEFINE_FILE "main.py"
   (λ generate_fibonacci (ι "count")
     (α result (Σ))
     (α a (ν 0))
     (α b (ν 1))
     (ρ _ (τ (κ "count"))
       (Σ+ result (κ "a"))
       (α temp (+ (κ "a") (κ "b")))
       (α a (κ "b"))
       (α b (κ "temp"))
     )
     (Ω result)
   )
)

(DEFINE_FILE "test_main.py"
   (ζ main generate_fibonacci)
   (λ-test test_generate_fibonacci
     (=
       (λ-call generate_fibonacci 10)
       (Σν 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34)
     )
   )
)

### CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES ###
**STRICTLY adhere to these output rules:**
- Output ONLY two Python code blocks and nothing else.
- The first block MUST be ONLY `# main.py` on its own line, followed immediately by its code block. DO NOT include any markdown headings like `**main.py**` before the `# main.py` line.
- The second block MUST be ONLY `# test_main.py` on its own line, followed immediately by its code block. DO NOT include any markdown headings like `**test_main.py**` before the `# test_main.py` line.
- Each code block MUST be enclosed in standard ```python fences.
- Use exactly 4 spaces for indentation.
- For `test_main.py`, ensure test functions start with `test_` and take no arguments.
- When importing functions from `main.py` into `test_main.py`, use `from main import <function_name>` instead of `import main`. This ensures that the function is only imported once, and not twice for each test function.
```
