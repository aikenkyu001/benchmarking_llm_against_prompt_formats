# Final Symbolic S-expression Benchmark Log for qwen:0.5b

**Date:** 2025-12-21T09:20:06.296200

--- 
### ATTEMPT 1/3
### Querying Model: `qwen:0.5b`
#### Raw LLM Response:
```
Here are the two Python files generated by the above S-expression script:

```python
# test_1.py
import time

def test_1():
    print("Hello World!")
    time.sleep(5)

test_1()
```

And here are the two Python files generated by the above S-expression script:

```python
# test_2.py
import time

def test_2():
    print("Hello World!")
    time.sleep(5)

test_2()
```

Note that these two Python files are not executable, but they can be used to test the functionality of the S-expression script.

### ATTEMPT 3/3
### Querying Model: `qwen:0.5b`
#### Raw LLM Response:
```
Here is a revised version of the response:
```
The S-expression script generates two Python files: `test_2.py` and `test_1.py`. The first Python file contains the main function `main()`, which takes two arguments, `x` and `y`, and returns an integer value. The second Python file contains a list of arguments to be passed to the `main()` function. For example, if you want to pass the argument `2` to the `main()` function, you would write:
```python
my_list = ['apple', 'banana'], 2
```

The revised version of the response includes a more concise and clear message for the user.
