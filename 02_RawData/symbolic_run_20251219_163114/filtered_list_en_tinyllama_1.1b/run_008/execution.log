### Querying Model: `tinyllama:1.1b`
#### Raw LLM Response (first 500 chars):
```
Here's a possible solution to the problem using Python's built-in list comprehension:

```python
def even_numbers(lst):
    return [num for num in lst if num % 2 == 0]

print(even_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])) # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8]
```

In this solution, we define a function `even_numbers` that takes a list as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers. We use a list comprehension to iterate over each element of the original list and check if it's even using the m...

**INFO:** Raw response contains code-like patterns. Treating as instruction violation.
