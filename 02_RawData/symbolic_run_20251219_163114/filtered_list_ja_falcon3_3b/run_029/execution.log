### Querying Model: `falcon3:3b`
#### Raw LLM Response (first 500 chars):
```
```python
# Given list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Filter out odd numbers to get only even numbers
even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]

print(even_numbers)
```

結果: `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`...
```
### Attempting to extract list directly from raw response (strictly): '```python
# Given list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Filter out odd numbers to get on...'
**INFO:** Raw response contains code-like patterns. Treating as instruction violation.
